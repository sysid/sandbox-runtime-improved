  Smoke test for `srt-win exec`.

  Self-contained: provisions WFP filters under a fixed test-only
  sublayer GUID and uses `BUILTIN\Administrators` (S-1-5-32-544) as
  the discriminator group SID. We do NOT create a custom group.

  Why Administrators as the group:
    - The custom-group approach can't exercise the WFP fence on
      hosted CI: the runner can't logout/login mid-job, so a freshly
      created group is *absent* from the token (not deny-only). With
      the machine-wide filter shape, an absent-group child is
      PERMITted by the non-member filter — the fence test would lie.
    - `BUILTIN\Administrators` IS in the runner token (the GHA
      Windows runner runs as admin). `srt-win exec` flips it
      deny-only along with the discriminator. The child therefore
      genuinely matches the BLOCK filter and is fenced.
    - It also means the broker pre-flight passes without
      `--skip-group-check` (Admins is enabled in the broker token),
      so we exercise the normal pre-flight path.

  This is a CI-only configuration. Production callers use a
  dedicated group. The `srt-win exec` code path is identical.

  The fixed sublayer GUID lets the workflow's `if: always()`
  cleanup step uninstall any leaked filters even if this script
  throws mid-run.
