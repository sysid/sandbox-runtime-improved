//! `srt-win` — Windows network sandbox helper for sandbox-runtime.
//!
//! This crate is the Rust half of the Windows backend. The library
//! exposes the SID, group, and WFP primitives so they can be unit-
//! tested; the binary (`main.rs`) is a thin CLI over them.
//!
//! Windows-only. Building on other platforms yields an empty crate so
//! `cargo check` from a non-Windows host doesn't error.
